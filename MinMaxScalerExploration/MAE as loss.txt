In summary, for MAE specifically, the choice between MinMaxScaler and RobustScaler may not have a significant impact on the metric itself, 
as it calculates absolute errors. However, if your dataset contains outliers, using RobustScaler can be a safer choice to prevent these outliers 
from disproportionately affecting your model's predictions. It's essential to consider the nature of your data and the specific requirements of 
your machine learning model when deciding which scaler to use.
